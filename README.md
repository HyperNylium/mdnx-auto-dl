# What is this?
MDNX-auto-dl is a free and open-source Python application that monitors and downloads anime from Crunchyroll and HiDive. Its main usage is to monitor new anime that has weekly episodes and download them to your plex/jellyfin/emby server.
This application only supports downloads from Crunchyroll and HiDive at the moment even though multi-download-nx supports more services. This may change in the future, but not planned as i dont have an account with other services.
